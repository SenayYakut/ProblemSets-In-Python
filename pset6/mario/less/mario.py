#Write, in a file called mario.py in ~/pset6/mario/less/, a program that recreates the half-pyramid using hashes (#) for blocks, exactly as you did in Problem Set 1, except that your program this time should be written (a) in Python and (b) in CS50 IDE.
#To make things more interesting, first prompt the user with get_int for the half-pyramidâ€™s height, a positive integer between 1 and 8, inclusive.

#If the user fails to provide a positive integer no greater than 8, you should re-prompt for the same again.
#Then, generate (with the help of print and one or more loops) the desired half-pyramid.
#Take care to align the bottom-left corner of your half-pyramid with the left-hand edge of your terminal window.

from cs50 import get_int

# while loop will continue until user inputs matches with expected input
while True:
    num = get_int("height: ")
    if num >= 1 and num <= 8:
        break
# For loop will iterate in the range of 1 and given number        
for i in range(1, num + 1):
    # Program will print num - i times empthy space and i times
    print(" " * (num-i) + "#" * i)
